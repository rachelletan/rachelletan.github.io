## fol. 1r
**_Jesus,
in God’s name. Amen._**
\[From\] Our Friar Antonio
de Tablada, current Visitor General and
Principal Minister, servant of all of our glorious father St Francis’s
Sacred Order of Penitence of regular 
observance in these kingdoms of Spain and
Portugal, and other parts and provinces, etc, and our President
and Limiters of this present General Chapter, which we celebrate
in the devout house and monastery of Our Lady St
Mary of the Valley of Asturias in the diocese determined by our said
Vistor General on this Sunday, the Octave of the Blessed
John the Baptist in this year, one thousand five hundred and 
twenty-eight (1528) years from the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
in which we are congregated with apostolic authority
by virtue of the holy bull _Ad uberes fructus_, once again
granted to us and to our Sacred Order of Penitence by our
most holy Pope Clement VII: 
To you, the very loved children, both brother friars and nuns, as those who
live together in houses and monasteries as hermits
and celibates, widows and married people, and religious men
and women of all our seraphic father St Francis’s Sacred Order of Penitence 
of the regular observance from all the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal 
and its provinces and other parts: 
As those who at present are under the yoke and
discipline of our obedience, just as those who were, from here onward
for ever and ever, health and peace to you within the Lord who is the true and
lasting health: 
You know well, and you ought to know, how much our
sacred community and Order of Penitence, with the divine hand governing it,
maintaining it, and enhancing it and adorning
it, has grown and has expanded, shone and flourished—not only

## fol. 1v
from notable barons and nuns, but from holy and clear
branches canonized by the Holy Apostolic See, whose
excellent lives and works shine like the
stars in the firmament of the sky, from whom lingers such a sweet
odor in divine observance, and who in this age have enjoyment of 
the fame of the most holy and blessed, giving everyone such
a notable example, and in the other perpetual and true
rest—which \[Order\], according to his ordinance, originated from and was started
and introduced by our blessed seraphic father St Francis, 
true shepherd and fisher of souls, illuminated and governed by the Holy Spirit,
and was put together, governed, approved, and commanded to obey
by our very holy Pope Nicholas IV of glorious
memory, and by other most supreme pontiffs,
confirmed and affirmed and grown from many indulgences
and pardons, naming it with the reason “of penitence.” And, it seems
and appears just as clear, they were examined by
the divine hand, through which they had such great fame, so as to
appear that it \[the Order\] was preordained, was founded, by our sovereign
God in an earthly Paradise, because—knowing in his divine wisdom
that our first father had sinned and so all of us with him—
he wanted to provide him \[Adam\] and us with the remedy and
medicine of penitence there where he established and ordered the penitence
with which \[people\] could weld our failures and defects and cause a
reconciliation between God and him, for where he \[Adam\] left and caused
death, He \[God\] would arise and resurrect life. 
Whereby: clearly the said sacred community and Order of Penitence appears
to be instituted, preordained, and founded there, and the 
growth has been such that, being established at the outset
for married people so that they might live in their houses and in
particular \[live\] beyond the divine precepts obligatory only to
