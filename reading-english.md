### fol. 1r
**_Jesus,
in God’s name. Amen._**
\[From\] Our Friar Antonio
de Tablada, current Visitor General and
Principal Minister, servant of all of our glorious father St Francis’s
Sacred Order of Penitence of regular 
observance in these kingdoms of Spain and
Portugal, and other parts and provinces, etc, and our President
and Limiters of this present General Chapter, which we celebrate
in the devout house and monastery of Our Lady St
Mary of the Valley of Asturias in the diocese determined by our said
Vistor General on this Sunday, the Octave of the Blessed
John the Baptist in this year, one thousand five hundred and 
twenty-eight (1528) years from the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
in which we are congregated with apostolic authority
by virtue of the holy bull _Ad uberes fructus_, once again
granted to us and to our Sacred Order of Penitence by our
most holy Pope Clement VII: 
To you, the very loved children, both brother friars and nuns, as those who
live together in houses and monasteries as hermits
and celibates, widows and married people, and religious men
and women of all our seraphic father St Francis’s Sacred Order of Penitence 
of the regular observance from all the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal 
and its provinces and other parts: 
As those who at present are under the yoke and
discipline of our obedience, just as those who were, from here onward
for ever and ever, health and peace to you within the Lord who is the true and
lasting health: 
You know well, and you ought to know, how much our
sacred community and Order of Penitence, with the divine hand governing it,
maintaining it, and enhancing it and adorning
it, has grown and has expanded, shone and flourished—not only

### fol. 1v
from notable barons and nuns, but from holy and clear
branches canonized by the Holy Apostolic See, whose
excellent lives and works shine like the
stars in the firmament of the sky, from whom lingers such a sweet
odor in divine observance, and who in this age have enjoyment of 
the fame of the most holy and blessed, giving everyone such
a notable example, and in the other perpetual and true
rest—which \[Order\], according to his ordinance, originated from and was started
and introduced by our blessed seraphic father St Francis, 
true shepherd and fisher of souls, illuminated and governed by the Holy Spirit,
and was put together, governed, approved, and commanded to obey
by our very holy Pope Nicholas IV of glorious
memory, and by other most supreme pontiffs,
confirmed and affirmed and grown from many indulgences
and pardons, naming it with the reason “of penitence.” And, it seems
and appears just as clear, they were examined by
the divine hand, through which they had such great fame, so as to
appear that it \[the Order\] was preordained, was founded, by our sovereign
God in an earthly Paradise, because—knowing in his divine wisdom
that our first father had sinned and so all of us with him—
he wanted to provide him \[Adam\] and us with the remedy and
medicine of penitence there where he established and ordered the penitence
with which \[people\] could weld our failures and defects and cause a
reconciliation between God and him, for where he \[Adam\] left and caused
death, He \[God\] would arise and resurrect life. 
Whereby: clearly the said sacred community and Order of Penitence appears
to be instituted, preordained, and founded there, and the 
growth has been such that, being established at the outset
for married people so that they might live in their houses and in
particular \[live\] beyond the divine precepts obligatory only to

### fol. 2r
obedience, now and many times since there have been and are
in it \[the Order\] men and women, friars and nuns, \[and\] academic
scholars who preach the divine word; and, permitting
the active life of married people, they live in many laudable
and honourable monasteries that they have made and acquired, where
they have elevated, raised, and illuminated their thoughts
and understandings and works in a contemplative life,
continually praising their saints and \[making\] divine
clamours and prayers \[in\] the name of their highest maker,
denying their own wills, subjecting them \[their wills\]
to the yoke of religion, pledging the three essential vows—
obedience, chastity, and poverty—valuing
divine things through genuine and steady means, abandoning
the world and its pleasures and vanities, enduring hunger,
cold, and thirst by sailing out to sea in that open ocean of contemplation
and continuing praise of our Sovereign Lord, exchanging
earthly possessions and leaving them for heavenly ones,
and \[leaving\] those temporary \[ones\] for perpetual ones. And since it \[the Order\] 
was established for one state \[of being\]—the divine providence
making use their immense benefits through it—it has been 
increased not only to married people but to friars
and nuns who live in convents, houses, and monasteries
together, and to hermitages and to celibate widowers
and to other people of this habit. 
So, certain of all this, by our very holy current Pope Clement VII,
searching through his spirit and considering
how much the said sacred community and Order
of Penitence might deserve to be honoured and praised,
through his open bull, graciously written in Latin and on
parchment, and at the end sealed with his stamp of lead hanging on those 
coloured silks, in accordance with the style and custom of

### fol. 2v
Rome, _as a permanent record of the matter_: “I confirm and
approve and once again grant \[that\] the said Sacred Order
and Religion of Penitence, based on indulgences and concessions
and preeminences, graces and liberties, exemptions,
pardons, privileges, prerogatives, and immunities, 
wanting and commanding that, just as through many other 
apostolic letters, it has had the exemption of the Orders that were 
established for our blessed father St Francis and has, between the first Order 
and the other Orders, been established, ordained, commanded, and judged 
in good judgment contradictory to the Roman Curia…” And it \[the bull\] 
has about three sentences in accordance with and executory to all
of the above. And the fourth sentence, by way of restitution, \[is\] given
for the auditors of the sacred Rota \[i.e., the registry book\] on confirmation
of the others with executory powers over all of them, which
do not have commixation nor annexation, and the book \[the Rota\] excepting entirely
the said Sacred Order and Convent of Penitence from the other Orders. 
And he \[Clement\] does not wish that they do not mix with each other
before it may be freely removed and principal Order itself be mendicant,
as the other Orders. And they may not have any prelate nor Ordinary nor
person of another Order, likewise of the minor observers,
as of family and cloister, be of another Order, nor
some other person, \[nor\] older or younger prelate, nor of
lower superiority, nor an entrance or exit in it. And 
the Visitor General Ministers are to be immediately subject,
for a time, as representatives to the holy Apostolic See,
taking them under his protection and refuge
and into all his Order. Likewise, “I confirm and once
again grant what they rejoice in: \[that\] the said Sacred Order of Spain,

### fol. 3r
the prelate, Visitor General Minister, and friars and nuns, hermits, and married people and religious people, and their houses and monasteries, and all their possessions and male and female servants and familiars, all the privileges, liberties, exemptions and prerogatives, immunities, indulgences, and pardons that the other four mendicant orders \(and St Clare\) have enjoyment of. They are granted, and should be granted from here onward, by the holy Apostolic See, or in another manner, not only by similarity to them but more equally and primarily and finally without any difference, freely and justly, and likewise as, them.” And moreover he \[Clement VII\] granted that all the estates of the above contents and \[those\] expressed below, that they are \[as\] friars and nuns who live together in convents upholding the three essential vows. It is fitting to know obedience, chastity, and poverty in particular. And hermits, widowers, chaste people and married people, and other people of the said Sacred Order of Penitence: may they become true siblings and communities from it. And he \[Clement VII\] defends, prohibits, refuses, and commands—under penalty of excommunication, beating, judgement and privation of dignities, professions, and benefits, and disqualification—to show others by way of the statute and declaration and of ordinance: that from here onward, no friar or person of the Order of St Francis of this observance, whether family member or cloistered or lay person or community, be called, as was customary, “Thirds,” like some of ours call them, but rather friars and nuns of the Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance of St Francis. They will be named this way in their writings and public acts. As in the other matter,

### fol. 3v
let them not be called nor named by another less honourable term, or enter into their monasteries, houses—and any properties—or visit the masters or ministers of the said Orders of Observance, either family or cloister, or by his commissaries, vicars, and ordinaries, nor by any other person, whether wishing to disturb or perturb, or inconvenience or alter \[the Order\] in whatever manner, or for whatever way that it may be or can be, or to \[visit\] his Visitor General Minister \[concerning\] the obedience, visitation, correction, superiority, and profession, or in any other manner public or secretly, \[or\] by virtue of whatever bull and apostolic graces *granted and in the future to be granted*—all of which, with the filing of a suit concerning an irritating decree, he has repealed and pleaded, that they be absolved of such punishment by no one except the Roman pontiff. Moreover, he gives power such that all the said four estates—the communities and individuals of this Sacred Order—can eat meat on all the Mondays of the year, in the same way that the eating of meat is not prohibited by the Roman Church from the Feast of St Martin until the Sunday when the Advent of the Lord is celebrated by the Church \[i.e., from Nov. 11 to early Dec.\]. Furthermore, His Holiness grants and has awarded and commands that only the Visitor General (and anyone who for a time he might delegate from his Order), and not any other, may receive or give the habit \[of the Order\] to anyone in this age who might come to this Sacred Order and Community of Penitence. They may not be received into its profession by another. And \[Clement commands\] that the friar, nun, community women or men in any path that \[they\] may be: if

### fol. 4r
they were not received and given the habit and profession of the said Order by him \[the Visitor General\]: they can neither be friars nor nuns nor community members of it, nor enjoy it or its privileges, liberties, and exemptions, nor can they wear its habit. And \[he commands\] that the said Visitor General Minister (or whoever he may delegate for a time to preside over the vow of the poor both in general and in particular, as with friars and nuns, hermits and community members, and \[all\] individuals of the said Order of Penitence)—*likewise* he grants and consents that if the Visitor were absent from the Roman or Royal Court, including because of illness, that he can extend the Chapter, ending at the time of the triennial. In such manner, which concerns the business of the Order, if impeded in the Roman Curia, he can act and extend it within the space of a year, and if in the Royal Court for half a year, and if because of illness or other intervening just cause, for three months until the said triennial would end. And in such manner the said Chapter may be celebrated and have force and place of the General Chapter. *Likewise*, he \[Clement VII\] commanded and established that that all the said four estates and people of his Order obey that Visitor General as the true pastor and prelate in each and everything that may be the concern of the said Order, and \[that\] they be and live under his obedience, visitation, correction, punishment, and reformation. And he \[Clement VII\] gives him power so that he may know to prepare for and minister unto the health of their souls accordingly. And regarding the conservation of the said Order and community: he can move and relocate the friars and nuns of the said Order, from one monastery to

### fol. 4v
another. And if he visits some monastery or house, and he faults the Minister or Abbess of that house \[as\] less skilled or \[the house as\] poorly governed, he can dismiss them, delegate, and put others in their place. And if the term of the administration of some Minister or Abbess is up \[and\] the said Visitor General cannot go to that monastery or houses to choose a \[new\] Minister or Abbess, he can extend them \[i.e., their terms\] until a convenient time, and those ministers and abbesses may regulate, govern, and make use of their professions until and during the extension like before. *Likewise*, he grants, gives, and commands that the religious women of the said sacred Order who live and might live in common are called nuns of the said Order; also, that the religious men can have, retain, and obtain whatever ecclesiastical benefices that the secular clerics would have, if those were assigned to them, with that condition that they may not pertain to Chapters. *Also*, he granted and approved all the graces, rules, liberties, and statutes granted by the holy Apostolic See, made and accustomed to be used until now by the said Order, and \[also\] the uses, customs, and Chapters that have been celebrated by the community of the said Order. And he gave power, permission, and authority so that in this present Chapter—which is the first that we celebrate after the giving of the said bull—that the said us (the Visitor General, President, and Limiters), might be able to act, order, and establish *as a permanent record of the matter*, in accordance with what seems fitting to us, the renewed Rule or Statutes, with its prologue and chapters, for all the four estates and the people of the said Order, into perpetuity for ever and ever. And he commanded, wished,

### fol. 5r
established, and ordered that it \[the new Rule\] might hold the force and place of the \[previous\] Rule as if \[written\] by His Holiness, that it might be done, ordered, established, and set, and that it might be inviolably kept and agreed to by all the friars and nuns of the said Order and by any other people of it \[the Order\], and not violated by any person. And thus, by us it is done, ordered, and established. His Holiness confirms and approves it and commands that it be read in  the chapters and convents and communities as that Rule, and just as the other Rules of all the other Orders are read, giving and granting authority to the said Visitor General Minister and those who were \[a Visitor General\] at some time, that they may be able to interpret and declare on whatever ambiguity that might occur for a time to the said Order \[in the\] rules, bulls, constitutions, statutes, and customs. And in all things aforementioned and written above, they and no other may interpret, declare, say, and pass judgement on them, and set their interpretation, declaration, decision, and judgment. In the said holy bull, given to us and to our Sacred Community and Order of Penitence, contains it, which bull commences: *Bishop **CLEMENT**, servant of the servants of God, for a permanent remembrance of this matter, for furtherance of the fruit of the womb, that is, the Sacred Order of Penitence, which the Seraphic, true fisher of men, for the benefit of all souls, appointed to be created, \[which\] he who did not hide himself from the heat of love in the Holy Spirit, the illumined Blessed Francis, founded, in awe of the Lord and said hitherto, etc.*—the which said bull, to avoid detailedness, we do not deem to include here (and because regarding it sufficient 

### fol. 5v
notice was given in the General Chapter to all the community members who attended it, prelates as well as subjects). And for himself, and in the name of the entire order, they obey it, together with the other bull: that in the execution of the said bull, he gives its sanctity. And also, he commands himself to give sufficient notice regarding the said bulls, to all the convents of the said order so that, more verifiably, he can be certain of the truth for them. And so, we have it here, *word for word*, in words and incorporation, and so on. And since those sayings to us, the Visitor General Minister and president and definers of the agreement and in accordance to all our general chapter which we celebrate here in this present *Sunday octave of the birth of the holy John the Baptist*. In this, our house and monastery, and the convent of St Mary of the Valley, of the *diocese of Asturias*. Seeing how well this is done and provided, and what in our other chapters we have done, established, and ordered. And customs that the Order has, we praise and approve all of it. And we establish and command, according to that in the relation of the said holy bull and in it and in the other bulls and apostolic faculties, statutes, ordinances, and customs it contains. And in this present time, and by the Apostolic Authority, it has been committed to us in this region by the said most holy Pope, our Clement VII, by the said holy bull he has granted us, and by the authority that he grants to us to carry out the renewed Rule, ordinances, constitutions, and statutes into perpetuity. May they be taken as the Rule and held in its entirety, force and vigour, conforming to us with the seasons and times, and providing

### fol. 6r
in the things that seem to us good and beneficial and useful, and \[as\] improves good governance and discipline and decorum and conservation of the said Order and Community of Penitence and the salvation of all the community members of it, using the said licence, power, and authority in that way and form and order that we are able to and ought to here in our General Chapter, first celebrated after the said granting of the said holy bull, assigned in this devout house of Our Lady St Mary of the Valley. We make, establish, and make known the Rule, ordinations, constitutions, ordinances, statutes, and following precepts.

¶. *The kingdom of heaven suffreth violence* (Matthew 11:12) *in accordance with penitence*. 

¶. Here begins the Rule of the Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance of our Seraphic father St Francis, likewise for the friars and nuns who live together in houses and monasteries as do the hermits, widowers, celibates, married people, and people of this age:

¶. The community of all the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal and any other region whatsoever.

¶ *Here it begins happily*.

¶ *Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand*. (Matthew 3:2 and 4:17)

¶ *\[From the Gospel of\] Matthew, Chapters 3 and 4*.

¶ Chapter 1: concerning the estates and people of this Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance.

### fol. 6v
First, we command and establish and declare that in this Sacred Order of Penitence there are four estates and different kinds of community members. As the Gospel says, “in my Father’s house there are many mansions” (John 14:2). And let it be in this way that the first and principal and most perfect estate is of the brothers and nuns who live in houses and convents together professing the three essential vows: it is fitting to know obedience, chastity, and poverty in particular. They pledge these vows from now onward and remember that which the Lord says in the holy Gospel, giving us doctrine as he would have us follow: he says, “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come follow me” (Matthew 19:21). And he says, moreover, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24). And those brothers of this first estate ought to be and will be priests, excepting those who the convents have and wish to have for the service of their houses and churches and people. The second estate \[is\] of hermits: those \[living\] in hermitages and deserts, following the hermitic life in imitation of the Desert Fathers from of the land of Egypt, who in the same way after they have taken up their vows carry out and pledge the said three essential vows. The third estate \[is\] of celibate and blessed widowers, and any other people who go dressed in this habit and occupation: those who pledge a vow of obedience to their prelates and a vow of

### fol. 7r
chastity and \[a vow to keep\] the divine commandments. The fourth estate \[is\] of married people, who likewise pledge a vow of obedience to their prelates and a vow of conjugal chastity and \[of\] the divine commandments in such a way so as to take up an occupation in this estate. Whoever of those that do it after \[a marriage\] would not be able to dissolve a marriage due to the death of someone, \[or\] to marry again, but remains forever in the third estate of celibate widowers. All those four estates His Holiness, as stated in his bull, recently granted to this Order (the which already reported above) for the true brothers and community members and nuns of the said holy Order of Penitence and for the true children of our father St Francis, so that by such, they are assisted and bound. They may delight *in an eternity* of merciful indulgences and pardons and freedoms, immunities, exceptions and privileges granted, and those being granted *in the future*, to the said Order and to the mendicant Orders and St Clare, and \[granted\] to us, the said Friar Antonio de Tablada, Visitor and General Minister, and the President and Limiters in this Chapter, for this, our Rule and declaration, with respect to the power granted to us, for such we hold and we delegate and we declare, now and from here onward forever and ever. This we declare to be the true intelligence of the said bull and of His Holiness who granted it.

¶ Chapter 2: what those of the first estate may take to keep as their own, and that the poor convents may beg for alms.

### fol. 7v
*In the same manner*, we command and establish that the brothers and nuns who live together do not have their own belongings in particular, except communally. But taking into consideration that most of the houses of the said sacred Order are poor and lack other necessities, we allow that the said Visitor General Minister, without committing someone else, can give permission in such a way to the male and female community members in particular, like the convents in the community, so that for life or temporarily, they can have their own \[belongings\] in private, all of those that for the same permission that was given to them in the same manner, that ceasing the same permission, all of which would be left over for them or would have to the convent where professed individuals go and to his community. And in the meantime, the Visitor General Minister handles his own conscience, who for the time that he is or will be so, that he uses this power comfortably, not having with respect to a particular passion, nor another thing except only help with or save the necessity that appears to him that there is, and they have those houses, community members, and people, without offering a hand to superfluous and voluntary matters. And because he makes clear to us (and we know in the said Sacred Order of Penitence), having many convents and poor houses this way of brothers, just like those of nuns and other male and female community members who are poor and live on \[begging for\] alms. We establish and declare that they can beg *from door to door* whatever alms in that manner, and as the other mendicant orders have begged. And for those faithful Christians who give them those alms, may they gain and obtain our thanks, pardons, and

### fol. 8r
indulgences, and for those who gain, obtain, and enjoy, those who give alms to the other mendicant Orders and St Clare. But we order that such male and female community members of the said convents or any other persons of the said four estates that when they go to beg \[for\] the said alms they would ask permission from their prelates or from the minister or of the abbess of those convents and *not from others* being with the same permission and blessing from the prelate, there is no shame to ask \[it from them\], but they go with much confidence. Because as the apostle St Paul says, the Lord “being rich became poor” in this world for our love (2 Corinthians 8:9). The religious women of the poor convents, who are in the habit of going out and begging, should maintain in their journeys all honesty and always send out the elderly and ancient people, of whom one cannot be suspicious: nothing bad can be said about such people nor set as a bad example. As said in the chapter of seclusion of the said Order, and with all that they brought and the said alms to be given, in the name of the said monasteries and order: in coming to their homes, faithfully, they come with all, to their ministers or abbesses or to whom oversees such \[giving of or asking for\] alms.

¶. Chapter 3: concerning the most reverend father, \[the\] Visitor General Minister, and of his power, charge, and office.
Let us resign ourselves to \[following\] the ancient customs used and maintained, and to the issued bulls and apostolic letters to the said Order, and because nothing that moves itself or persuades

### fol. 8v
can be well regulated and governed and persuaded. If from a principle or principal cause, one cannot be governed and directed, we order \[and\] establish that from here onward for ever and ever, let there be a Visitor General Minister in this sacred Order and community \[who is\] a professed \[monk\] and priest of that \[Order\], who is the first and principal purpose of that \[Order\]. \[He is the\] master and governor in the said Order of Penitence of friars, nuns, female community members, and people of all the said four estates, in such a way that he is the head, and those \[people are\] members, just like the father to his children, and as the father loves his children, and he places the necessity to love them: as in to the Visitor General Minister that there is, and he himself fails to love the same in loving to govern and rule his subjects, children, and community members. And like our Master, he places the yoke of obedience on His Son so that He may love the Father. And in this way, those community members of the said estates and other people of the said Order may have for themselves this true yoke of obedience to perfectly obey the said Visitor General Minister, his true prelate and spiritual father to whom all have obedience and reverence, according to them and continually holding a place in their memory: whereas obedience is of the greatest efficacy than sacrifice because the truly humble sacrifices himself and his works, denying his own will for those men who deserve them more, taking as example our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who said to his disciples in the name of everyone, “Learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart” (Matthew 11:29). Concerning which manner: we most entrust and prescribe to those who are especially

### fol. 9r
subject to the said father, the Visitor General Minister, from all the said estates and people of the said Order. And to the said Visitor General Minister belongs \[the responsibility of\] the visitation, reformation, correction, punishment, and penalty for himself and his visiting commissioners of all the said four estates, and to each one of them and to any other people of the said Order. And he can proceed to correct, punish, and reform those who are behaving against them, from a permanent dismissal or to a temporary incarceration, and in other punishments and censorships and sentences of major or minor excommunication and to disable them or enable them and absolve them according to the quality of his merits and crimes. All in all and for all he, let him be obeyed like his true prelate and pastor and father, next to the Holy Apostolic See. And let him proceed in the same way against all those who have been or have gone astray from their obedience for those who carry out, take, and subdue it. And to him belongs, in the same manner, the governance and administration of his people, assets, houses, monasteries, and convents of all the said Order in what is spiritual and temporary as to the next true prelate and may the Visitor General Minister use of all the superiority and jurisdiction and authority, seniority, and power just as the other prelates and General Ministers of the mendicant orders do as it is contained in the said \[papal\] bull, and we wish that his power may be so generous and extensive, that in

### fol. 9v
all that he would decree, order, and command such in \[his\] visitations as in \[his\] corrections, elections, confirmations, distinctions, commandments, and precepts. Let him be cooperative and generous, and let him be and let there be his proper intention according to his disposition although he controls all or a part of it from the commanded disposition against the rules expressed by the common law. Because as the master and superior prelate trusting in his authority, he accepts and he gives it all his might the general administration and generous power.

¶ Chapter 4: concerning the election of the most reverend father, the Visitor General Minister, and of the celebration of the Chapter.
We decree \[and\] establish *in the time to come forever*, from triennial to triennial, let the said Visitor General Minister be elected in whole the said Order of Penitence, let him be a said professed priest of that \[Order\], and let his service last only for that triennial in which he was elected, except unless he turns to be for other or other triennials successively re-elected. But we permit \[and\] establish that if the said Visitor General Minister were in the Roman Curia, absent from the business of the Order, then he can extend his office as Visitor for the duration of one year, and if he were in the royal court for half a year, and if he were impeded by some just impediment or

### fol. 10r
by illness or by other necessary cause, then he may be allowed to extend \[his term\] for the first three months following everything *at the end of the triennial*, and that in this extended time use respectively his service, and may he have that same power and authority that \[he had\] during his triennial or tenure without any limitation or loss, and that from here onward and *forever*, let him be called and celebrated the General Chapter in this our monastery of the blessed Mary of the Valley *of the Asturian diocese*, as the convenient and most opportune place for that \[celebration\] for being where it is located. And there, to that celebration and to the said General Chapter, let the ministers of all those monasteries of the said Order attend, except those impeded by sickness or old age, or by other reasonable cause, and with permission from the Visitor General Minister. And let the discreet representatives go with them from their homes, and let each monastery have two votes belonging to the community members. It is advisable to know one vote the minister and another the discreet in the name of the community, which the discreet \[person\] carries the power of the convent firmly *inscribed* by the community members from their convent, and for the assigned day for the celebration of the said Chapter before all things. He is chosen by four definitive votes and a president, a scribe, good barons, wise men, and God-fearing men. And let the said Visitor General Minister resign from his office in the hands of the president, definers, and the Chapter \[over\] which

### fol. 10v
the president presides, and let the said Chapter have \[him\] as prelate. After the Visitor General has resigned from his office, but before he resigns \[and\] presides in resigning it, his power ceases. Let the president preside and hear the grievances of everyone. Let him perform and administer justice as it seems in agreement with the community. Let the said election of the said Visitor General Minister be carried out by secret ballot, securing the votes under oath. Let the votes be identical in quality, and let the president, definers, and the scribe vote first, and later, the ministers after the discreet representatives. And let it be that the Visitor General Minister was elected by the major part of the votes that surpass the middle. And if in case there would be a parity in the votes (voting for two community members), let him obtain and prefer the election where the majority of the ministers are in agreement. And if the ministers are in agreement in the same grade, let him obtain and prefer the election where the majority of the definers are in agreement. And if among the definers there is parity, let him obtain and prefer the election where the president will be voted by the said Chapter. And let it be done and celebrated most briefly, with all peace and calm that can be \[had\], laying above him sentences and censures of excommunication. Let it be throughout that the said president be obeyed as \[a\] prelate. And upon taking into account the votes, let him not be the current president, unless he understand in which the

### fol. 11r
said Chapter is celebrated with all peace and calm. Let his office and power last until such a time that the said Visitor General Minister may be elected. In disclosing his election, the power of the said president ceases, and from here onward the said Visitor General Minister, as prelate, immediately ought to be obeyed on behalf of all the sayings of the president, definers, and by the whole said Order and Chapter. Let his orders be fulfilled *in spirits and temporalities* according to what is said. And in such election of the said prelate and Visitor General Minister, all manner of ambition, greed, cunning, persuasion ceases. Above all, let there be and let a holy and right intention proceed in a manner that is not of passion, love, fondness, gifts, promises, or of other respective cause or contemplation. Let the Visitor General Minister be chosen, as well as the president, the definers, and the scribe. Above all, we entrust the consciences to the voters. And \[to\] those who fail to vote because of bribery, or who performed trickeries, or those who give favourable advice and help to him publicly or secretly: the curse of our Lord God and of our father St Francis. Let him inflict upon them the day of extreme justice (let them give short account of that to our Lord Jesus Christ!), and let them fall into the penalty of privation of that office, and let them be disqualified for ten years in order to have or hold others, and let them be deprived of legal acts for the duration of the said time.

¶ Chapter 5: concerning the submission of the Visitor General.

### fol. 11v
Why the said Visitor General Minister ought to perform his service more fairly. We order \[and\] establish that during the said triennial and all the time which postpone him according to what is said, if against God or against the Order or his riches, he commits a crime which the president and the definers who were mentioned from the immediate past chapter, in those said cases (or in another of those), let them correct and punish him, and if such were his excesses and crimes close to the abovementioned things, let the said president and definers be able to call upon the General Chapter, in which his demerits may be seen. Let the majority of the Chapter deprive him of his office, *according to law* to choose another in his place, the same way as how he is accustomed to be chosen and the said bull stipulates it.

¶ Chapter 6: concerning the election and confirmation of the ministers and abbesses.
Wanting to acquiesce ourselves with us the ancient custom of the said Order, we order and establish that the ministers and abbesses of each house and convent from the community of all the said Order be elected and be re-elected from triennial to triennial for the majority of the votes from those convents where there ought to be a copy of them. Let them elect canonically and saintly and let it be done under scrutiny with an oath that they make on the hand of the prelate. Let the voters

### fol. 12r
vote under the responsibility of an oath to whom it would seem better for the said responsibility and [to whom it would] be more sufficient. That election must take the said prelate as is the custom in this said Order of Penitence. If there would be a parity, let the election may be preferred where the more ancient ones agree, and if in this case there would be a parity, let the prelate elect the person from those elected that seems to him is the most necessary for the said responsibility. It pertains to him the confirmation of those services or to whom his special power for him he may have. Let the said election be done, ceasing all cautions, forms, trickeries, and ambitions. And to the minister or abbess or any other male or female community members, who in this was found publicly or secretly, and to procure some service for himself or for other, they incur the punishments declared in the chapter that speaks of the election of the Visitor General and in the bull containing *Ad uberes fructus*. And if in case they do not settle for it, or if the said election was not done canonically and justly, or if it seems to the prelate that the election and votes they gave him were not in favour of the person sufficiently for what is agreeable to the service of God and to the well-being of the house, then in such case the election of that minister or abbess becomes the responsibility of the said Visitor. And we entrust to the said Visitor and to his visiting commissaries their conscience to this effect, his representatives, who elect the

### fol. 12v
person who seems better to them and would appear to be more useful and beneficial for the service of God and for the good governance of that convent. And where there is no copy \[of the votes\], among the male and female community members, let the said Visitor provide it, and let him choose someone who seems to him is sufficient for such a responsibility. Throughout what is mentioned before, let the said Visitor General Minister have entire power and authority, and which the other prelates of the other mendicant Orders have for all, to provide and to make it as to them it seems as it is contained in the said \[papal\] bull. Moreover, we order that if the triennial of the minister or abbess is completed, the Visitor General (or who has his power as the commissioner), ought not go so promptly to visit that monastery to hold the election of the minister or abbess. We establish \[and\] declare that the said services of the minister or abbess ought not to cease, or ought to be seen to cease or fall vacant until the prelate takes them into consideration. He may not renounce the said office in his hands of that convent where he was prelate, and it pertains to the said Visitor General Minister the assignment of the brothers, nuns, and people who have to live in the convents of the said Order, and for their merits or poor governance, he may deprive those ministers or abbesses and officials, and elect others once again in his services and responsibilities, and relocate the brothers and nuns from one convent to another according to what seems to him is advisable to the well-being of

### fol. 13r
their spirits, and to the peace and calm and conservation of the Order according to what the aforementioned contains. Let him proceed against all in all criminal cases and excesses as it seems fitting to him. And if someone were discovered to be marked with the crime of heresy, let him proceed likewise against them as there is a better right-of-way in such a way that in the same community he does penance and is punished according to his crime. And how many to what is in this chapter says about the ministers and abbesses who may be re-elected. For some reasons that move us, we declare and order that, having in that convent or convents where the election is held, a person or persons \[who are\] skilled and fit to be a minister or abbess who in that case regarding that triennial, ought not to succeed the said ministers or abbesses, who at that time have been, to be re-elected in those convents where they have been prelates in that past triennial, except in the case of necessity of the people (as it is said). But for other convents, let the male and female community members be equally elected. Above all, let the father, the Visitor General Minister, see and provide to what is more convenient for the service of God and the well-being of those convents, as well as in approval and setting once again, holding over everyone, the general administration.

¶ Chapter 7: concerning the appointment of the male and female vicars of the convents.  
We establish and order that in the

### fol. 13v
said monasteries and convents, it pertains to the minister or abbess of every convent to appoint a male or female vicar for his or her triennial for helping him or her alleviate the load of his or her service. Let that Visitor General accept and receive that appointment, except if for some reasonable cause another reason appears to him, which, in that case, for the well-being and peace and calm, he may select another male or female vicar in accordance with the other brothers or nuns of that convent and religious administrators, representatives, providers, sacristans, doorkeepers, and other offices of the convents. He or she complies with the Visitor General and with the ministers and abbesses and with the advice of the discreet men and women of the said houses. And in it, let the prelate provide, as it is advisable, to the service of God and well-being of the communities.

¶ Chapter 8: concerning the constitution and power of the visiting commissioners, likewise the Visitor General as “provincials.”
*In the same manner* insofar as the said Visitor General Minister likewise for impediments of sickness as if by absence, as if by being, many houses under his responsibility and administration, he would not be able to, kindly by himself, visit \[those houses\] and do what is advisable for the good administration and governance of his office. And he has the necessity of the people who therein helps him \[carry out his responsibilities\]. Thus,

### fol. 14r
we establish and order that from here onward *perpetually* let him appoint and select one or two
or more provincial visiting commissaries and one general commissioner, who may be from this Order and office for \[this purpose\], and those to revoke and to make others again as many times he would wish during the time of his triennial, and that such replacement and power may not last more than the time of his triennial. Let those commissaries use of their duty and special or general power that \[the Visitor General Minister\] gives them and no more, and he who extends it longer may not be worth what he has done, and for that reason, let him be punished. And to the Order that does it to him, let him not cause it harm.

¶ Chapter 9: concerning the manner of the Visitor.
We determine and order that the said Visitor General Minister or his representative commissaries deputies for the time being, on his behalf, ought to visit, once a year, all the monasteries of the brothers and nuns of those if they are able to do it, and the people of the said Order. Let him carry out the visitation as is the custom, and if there is necessity to visit more times, he may do so. That visitation, let it be done, in \[his\] part, honestly and without suspicion. And regarding his visitation, he should not enter the secret parts \[of the monasteries\] and the cloister of the convent of nuns, and not be alone with any nun, save in public areas,

### fol. 14v
honestly and without suspicion. In that visitation, the ministers and abbesses respectively denounce to the Visitor the obvious faults of their brothers and nuns. Likewise, one another, in order that he may fight and punish them. And if someone were found incorrigible (after having been at other times reprimanded or for some space and interval of days), let that person be denounced to the said Visitor General, who, with the advice of those more senior of those convents, may punish and fight that person as it seems fitting to him, incarcerating them whether *permanently or temporarily*. And if that person, whatever his crime and excess, was \[found\] incorrigible, deserving of his crime, affecting all of the said community and Order, removing the habit from him as if he had not been a son of it, because it is not permitted for a brother nor nun in the said Order to defame it and be incorrigible. And let them avoid and cut from \[the Order\] the same damaging, scandalous, and fruitless *branches*. As the Holy Gospel says, “Every tree that doth not yield fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire” (Matthew 3:10).

¶ Chapter 10: concerning the manner that may be had in the reception of the novices and qualities with which they are received.
Let us conform ourselves to the laudable and most ancient custom of the said Order and with our privileges and \[papal\] bulls and apostolic briefs because the most reverend

### fol. 15r
father, the Visitor General Minister, as the true prelate and pastor, has to tread attentively in matters pertaining and convenient to the said Order. And nothing must ever be done therein without his authority and consent. As the Gospel says, “the good shepherd” knows his sheep, and they know him, and “he giveth his life for his sheep” (John 10:11 and 10:14). Thus, we establish and order that from here onward forever and ever, not one person from any estate can be, or be admitted or received, to the said Order and community, nor may he be given the habit or their office, except in the hands of the said Visitor General (or whom he appoints and delegates for it) with so much that he may be of his Order. He who, in another way and from other people, was received or took up the habit or office, in no way be or allowed to be tied to the said Order, or be had by the number and with an associate of it. Let him not enjoy the privileges and exemptions, or of anything of it, before he may be had by a private person, and that in the said Order, let him not have neither entrance nor exit, or have its habit, in conformance to the apostolic bulls that prohibit it. All the brothers, nuns, and people who are received to the said sacred Order and community of all the said four estates and other people of it, have to be interrogated first. If they come to it on their own good will, or by reward or persuasion by something, it has to be done first,

### fol. 15v
a diligent examination of his reputation, for the sake of protecting faithful and Catholic Christians from heresy of those suspiciously unfirm in the obedience of the Roman Church, and \[so as\] not to tie \[them\] to any link that impedes the reception of the habit and community of the said sacred Order. Those that have been received to live in the schools and hermitages ought to be healthy of body, and none of any estate of the aforementioned has to be defamed by any vulgar infamy. And first let him be reconciled with their *neighbours*, and if the Visitor General were satisfied, and his convents are of good reputation, and the person who comes to enter into the said Order and is the type that ought to be received in it, he ought to tell \[the Visitor General\] about his life and aspirations in \[the Order\] to see if it pleases him to enter and persevere in it. And if they fail him definitely, and still desires to be a brother and a community member, and that by divine inspiration he comes and desires, disregarding the world, to take up that state of life, to uphold the said Rule and to serve God in this community, give him the habit, and receive him and this, in the schools and monasteries of the said Order, by authority of the said Visitor General or from his commissaries, living under his rule and discipline. After one year and the following first days that he may have worn the said habit when prompted by the Visitor General or by his commissaries, if he wishes to take up office in the said Order and community.

### fol. 16r
And if it would please him for him to be admitted to the profession, let it be given to him, being content for the most part of the convent and finding what is skilled for the said Order. In another way, neither before the year and day of the said approval may not be received, or admitted to the office, or may it be given to him *in the meantime*, and they will be assigned by the prelate masters, who teach and indoctrinate them in the ways of the Order. But let us conform to the \[papal\] bulls of our Order and to our privileges and ancient customs. With the said holy bull awarded to us once again by the said our very holy Pope Clement VII, we establish, order, declare, and permit that before the said year in any part of it, from the said Visitor General or his commissaries, attentive to the instance from which he asks him, and his devotion and who expressly waives the said year and day of approval, and would ask the said office, which can be given to him and is given to him as long as he may be content as said is the major part of the convent. If it be from the community, let him be had and held by that brother friar or by a professed nun of the Order, in all the said four estates (and whichever one of it) and people of the said Order, so that he may be admitted and enjoy the privileges of the said Order of Penitence as a true community member of it, and all this may be settled in a book that each convent ought to have so that he may be sure of it. Let him be given (and we give him) the said book in full faith and credit,

### fol. 16v
being signed by that Visitor General or by his commissaries, in the presence of the minister or abbess of each convent, as if it were to be passed before a notary public. And none who were thus received to the said Order and given its said office may leave or change at this age, or transferred to another Order even though it may be more constricted and approved by the Roman church, except with the permission and consent expressed by the said Visitor General Minister or by the defining of the General Chapter. And if that permission were not given to him, let him be obligated to remain all of his life in \[that Order\], and for no apostolic authority may he leave or be released from the obedience of the said Order, except if \[given permission from\] the highest pontiff with just and reasonable cause and making mention of this approbation and statute, which gives him authority to this effect.

¶ Chapter 11: that there may be male and female masters of the male and female novices, and what has to be done and practiced in the year of the noviciate.
*In the same way* we establish and order that in the monasteries and convents of friars and nuns of the said Order, let there be male and female masters of male and female novices to avoid the passions, about which the male and female masters indoctrinate and teach to those male and female novices \[in order to\] to love and know God well, and \[the masters\] instruct \[the novices\]

### fol. 17r
in their holy Catholic faith and accustom them to be devout, honest, humble, and obedient to their male or female prelates. By the manner that in those shine all virtue, honesty, humility, obedience, and religion. And in the year of their novitiate, \[the master\] should teach and instill in them all the harshnesses of the Order, making them used to practice so that he \[is\] better certain of them and \[so as\] to serve and perform community services. And in the same way, with much care and vigilance, they should work with the people who are choir members, as they are accountable and know all that is necessary to reach, pray, and regulate the divine worship, with which they should try to familiarize the said male and female masters very well, as well as the obedience and reverence which they have to have for their male and female prelates and to the other senior people of the Order. And may \[the masters\] pull the said male and female novices who stray back from the conversation of the people and from the gatekeepers and place their love with God. And if, in case of much necessity, he may speak with some person with the authority of the male or female prelate and in the presence of their male or female master. And if the female master were not elderly, let an elderly \[woman\] from the more senior ranks and the novices accompany them. In the year of their novitiate they will place on the tip of the hood, to be recognized, a small piece of woolen cloth sewn on the tip of the hood. Let the novices wear only their caps, headscarves, and shawl. And when the time comes for \[the novices\] to take up their vows, they will receive the veil, which will be

### fol. 17v
aligned with the signification of the resurrection of our Redemptor Jesus Christ.

¶ Chapter 12: concerning the habit and dress of the first estate of friars and nuns, who live in the community of isolation and retreat, which they have to uphold and maintain.
We order, establish, and command that the habit and mantle which the friars and nuns have to wear in the community of all the said Order be of modest cloth, more black than white, as the colour of the buriel (a type of reddish-brown woolen cloth) of Aragon. And let all of them wear the cord of hemp like the sons of the well-ventured father, St Francis. Let the friars wear a hood with two points *in the manner* of the cross behind it that reaches the cord and in front of the mouth of the stomach, a little more or less, and let the mantles of the said friars will be closed together and open at the front with clasps or buttons, or a little closed as it becomes modesty, and the aforementioned clothes of the friars and nuns and religious persons of the said Order, or things that they wear. Let them not wear silk or silk cords, or \[clothing\] stitched by backstitch or sewing that is not honest or is of bad example. Let the said friars wear tunics \[made\] under the religious or humble cloth, sock breeches of honest cloth that reach the top of the knee with their black laced shoes, and let them wear everything else that conforms to the community, according to the color …
