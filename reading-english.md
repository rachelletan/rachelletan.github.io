**_Jesus,
in God’s name. Amen._**
\[From\] Our Friar Antonio
de Tablada, current Visitor General and
Principal Minister, servant of all of our glorious father St Francis’s
Sacred Order of Penitence of regular 
observance in these kingdoms of Spain and
Portugal, and other parts and provinces, etc, and our President
and Limiters of this present General Chapter, which we celebrate
in the devout house and monastery of Our Lady St
Mary of the Valley of Asturias in the diocese determined by our said
Vistor General on this Sunday, the Octave of the Blessed
John the Baptist in this year, one thousand five hundred and 
twenty-eight (1528) years from the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
in which we are congregated with apostolic authority
by virtue of the holy bull _Ad uberes fructus_, once again
granted to us and to our Sacred Order of Penitence by our
most holy Pope Clement VII: 
To you, the very loved children, both brother friars and nuns, as those who
live together in houses and monasteries as hermits
and celibates, widows and married people, and religious men
and women of all our seraphic father St Francis’s Sacred Order of Penitence 
of the regular observance from all the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal 
and its provinces and other parts: 
As those who at present are under the yoke and
discipline of our obedience, just as those who were, from here onward
for ever and ever, health and peace to you within the Lord who is the true and
lasting health: 
You know well, and you ought to know, how much our
sacred community and Order of Penitence, with the divine hand governing it,
maintaining it, and enhancing it and adorning
it, has grown and has expanded, shone and flourished—not only

### fol. 1v
from notable barons and nuns, but from holy and clear
branches canonized by the Holy Apostolic See, whose
excellent lives and works shine like the
stars in the firmament of the sky, from whom lingers such a sweet
odor in divine observance, and who in this age have enjoyment of 
the fame of the most holy and blessed, giving everyone such
a notable example, and in the other perpetual and true
rest—which \[Order\], according to his ordinance, originated from and was started
and introduced by our blessed seraphic father St Francis, 
true shepherd and fisher of souls, illuminated and governed by the Holy Spirit,
and was put together, governed, approved, and commanded to obey
by our very holy Pope Nicholas IV of glorious
memory, and by other most supreme pontiffs,
confirmed and affirmed and grown from many indulgences
and pardons, naming it with the reason “of penitence.” And, it seems
and appears just as clear, they were examined by
the divine hand, through which they had such great fame, so as to
appear that it \[the Order\] was preordained, was founded, by our sovereign
God in an earthly Paradise, because—knowing in his divine wisdom
that our first father had sinned and so all of us with him—
he wanted to provide him \[Adam\] and us with the remedy and
medicine of penitence there where he established and ordered the penitence
with which \[people\] could weld our failures and defects and cause a
reconciliation between God and him, for where he \[Adam\] left and caused
death, He \[God\] would arise and resurrect life. 
Whereby: clearly the said sacred community and Order of Penitence appears
to be instituted, preordained, and founded there, and the 
growth has been such that, being established at the outset
for married people so that they might live in their houses and in
particular \[live\] beyond the divine precepts obligatory only to

### fol. 2r
obedience, now and many times since there have been and are
in it \[the Order\] men and women, friars and nuns, \[and\] academic
scholars who preach the divine word; and, permitting
the active life of married people, they live in many laudable
and honourable monasteries that they have made and acquired, where
they have elevated, raised, and illuminated their thoughts
and understandings and works in a contemplative life,
continually praising their saints and \[making\] divine
clamours and prayers \[in\] the name of their highest maker,
denying their own wills, subjecting them \[their wills\]
to the yoke of religion, pledging the three essential vows—
obedience, chastity, and poverty—valuing
divine things through genuine and steady means, abandoning
the world and its pleasures and vanities, enduring hunger,
cold, and thirst by sailing out to sea in that open ocean of contemplation
and continuing praise of our Sovereign Lord, exchanging
earthly possessions and leaving them for heavenly ones,
and \[leaving\] those temporary \[ones\] for perpetual ones. And since it \[the Order\] 
was established for one state \[of being\]—the divine providence
making use their immense benefits through it—it has been 
increased not only to married people but to friars
and nuns who live in convents, houses, and monasteries
together, and to hermitages and to celibate widowers
and to other people of this habit. 
So, certain of all this, by our very holy current Pope Clement VII,
searching through his spirit and considering
how much the said sacred community and Order
of Penitence might deserve to be honoured and praised,
through his open bull, graciously written in Latin and on
parchment, and at the end sealed with his stamp of lead hanging on those 
coloured silks, in accordance with the style and custom of

### fol. 2v
Rome, _as a permanent record of the matter_: “I confirm and
approve and once again grant \[that\] the said Sacred Order
and Religion of Penitence, based on indulgences and concessions
and preeminences, graces and liberties, exemptions,
pardons, privileges, prerogatives, and immunities, 
wanting and commanding that, just as through many other 
apostolic letters, it has had the exemption of the Orders that were 
established for our blessed father St Francis and has, between the first Order 
and the other Orders, been established, ordained, commanded, and judged 
in good judgment contradictory to the Roman Curia…” And it \[the bull\] 
has about three sentences in accordance with and executory to all
of the above. And the fourth sentence, by way of restitution, \[is\] given
for the auditors of the sacred Rota \[i.e., the registry book\] on confirmation
of the others with executory powers over all of them, which
do not have commixation nor annexation, and the book \[the Rota\] excepting entirely
the said Sacred Order and Convent of Penitence from the other Orders. 
And he \[Clement\] does not wish that they do not mix with each other
before it may be freely removed and principal Order itself be mendicant,
as the other Orders. And they may not have any prelate nor Ordinary nor
person of another Order, likewise of the minor observers,
as of family and cloister, be of another Order, nor
some other person, \[nor\] older or younger prelate, nor of
lower superiority, nor an entrance or exit in it. And 
the Visitor General Ministers are to be immediately subject,
for a time, as representatives to the holy Apostolic See,
taking them under his protection and refuge
and into all his Order. Likewise, “I confirm and once
again grant what they rejoice in: \[that\] the said Sacred Order of Spain,

### fol. 3r
the prelate, Visitor General Minister, and friars and nuns, hermits, and married people and religious people, and their houses and monasteries, and all their possessions and male and female servants and familiars, all the privileges, liberties, exemptions and prerogatives, immunities, indulgences, and pardons that the other four mendicant orders \(and St Clare\) have enjoyment of. They are granted, and should be granted from here onward, by the holy Apostolic See, or in another manner, not only by similarity to them but more equally and primarily and finally without any difference, freely and justly, and likewise as, them.” And moreover he \[Clement VII\] granted that all the estates of the above contents and \[those\] expressed below, that they are \[as\] friars and nuns who live together in convents upholding the three essential vows. It is fitting to know obedience, chastity, and poverty in particular. And hermits, widowers, chaste people and married people, and other people of the said Sacred Order of Penitence: may they become true siblings and communities from it. And he \[Clement VII\] defends, prohibits, refuses, and commands—under penalty of excommunication, beating, judgement and privation of dignities, professions, and benefits, and disqualification—to show others by way of the statute and declaration and of ordinance: that from here onward, no friar or person of the Order of St Francis of this observance, whether family member or cloistered or lay person or community, be called, as was customary, “Thirds,” like some of ours call them, but rather friars and nuns of the Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance of St Francis. They will be named this way in their writings and public acts. As in the other matter,

### fol. 3v
let them not be called nor named by another less honourable term, or enter into their monasteries, houses—and any properties—or visit the masters or ministers of the said Orders of Observance, either family or cloister, or by his commissaries, vicars, and ordinaries, nor by any other person, whether wishing to disturb or perturb, or inconvenience or alter \[the Order\] in whatever manner, or for whatever way that it may be or can be, or to \[visit\] his Visitor General Minister \[concerning\] the obedience, visitation, correction, superiority, and profession, or in any other manner public or secretly, \[or\] by virtue of whatever bull and apostolic graces *granted and in the future to be granted*—all of which, with the filing of a suit concerning an irritating decree, he has repealed and pleaded, that they be absolved of such punishment by no one except the Roman pontiff. Moreover, he gives power such that all the said four estates—the communities and individuals of this Sacred Order—can eat meat on all the Mondays of the year, in the same way that the eating of meat is not prohibited by the Roman Church from the Feast of St Martin until the Sunday when the Advent of the Lord is celebrated by the Church \[i.e., from Nov. 11 to early Dec.\]. Furthermore, His Holiness grants and has awarded and commands that only the Visitor General (and anyone who for a time he might delegate from his Order), and not any other, may receive or give the habit \[of the Order\] to anyone in this age who might come to this Sacred Order and Community of Penitence. They may not be received into its profession by another. And \[Clement commands\] that the friar, nun, community women or men in any path that \[they\] may be: if

### fol. 4r
they were not received and given the habit and profession of the said Order by him \[the Visitor General\]: they can neither be friars nor nuns nor community members of it, nor enjoy it or its privileges, liberties, and exemptions, nor can they wear its habit. And \[he commands\] that the said Visitor General Minister (or whoever he may delegate for a time to preside over the vow of the poor both in general and in particular, as with friars and nuns, hermits and community members, and \[all\] individuals of the said Order of Penitence)—*likewise* he grants and consents that if the Visitor were absent from the Roman or Royal Court, including because of illness, that he can extend the Chapter, ending at the time of the triennial. In such manner, which concerns the business of the Order, if impeded in the Roman Curia, he can act and extend it within the space of a year, and if in the Royal Court for half a year, and if because of illness or other intervening just cause, for three months until the said triennial would end. And in such manner the said Chapter may be celebrated and have force and place of the General Chapter. *Likewise*, he \[Clement VII\] commanded and established that that all the said four estates and people of his Order obey that Visitor General as the true pastor and prelate in each and everything that may be the concern of the said Order, and \[that\] they be and live under his obedience, visitation, correction, punishment, and reformation. And he \[Clement VII\] gives him power so that he may know to prepare for and minister unto the health of their souls accordingly. And regarding the conservation of the said Order and community: he can move and relocate the friars and nuns of the said Order, from one monastery to

### fol. 4v
another. And if he visits some monastery or house, and he faults the Minister or Abbess of that house \[as\] less skilled or \[the house as\] poorly governed, he can dismiss them, delegate, and put others in their place. And if the term of the administration of some Minister or Abbess is up \[and\] the said Visitor General cannot go to that monastery or houses to choose a \[new\] Minister or Abbess, he can extend them \[i.e., their terms\] until a convenient time, and those ministers and abbesses may regulate, govern, and make use of their professions until and during the extension like before. *Likewise*, he grants, gives, and commands that the religious women of the said sacred Order who live and might live in common are called nuns of the said Order; also, that the religious men can have, retain, and obtain whatever ecclesiastical benefices that the secular clerics would have, if those were assigned to them, with that condition that they may not pertain to Chapters. *Also*, he granted and approved all the graces, rules, liberties, and statutes granted by the holy Apostolic See, made and accustomed to be used until now by the said Order, and \[also\] the uses, customs, and Chapters that have been celebrated by the community of the said Order. And he gave power, permission, and authority so that in this present Chapter—which is the first that we celebrate after the giving of the said bull—that the said us (the Visitor General, President, and Limiters), might be able to act, order, and establish *as a permanent record of the matter*, in accordance with what seems fitting to us, the renewed Rule or Statutes, with its prologue and chapters, for all the four estates and the people of the said Order, into perpetuity for ever and ever. And he commanded, wished,

### fol. 5r
established, and ordered that it \[the new Rule\] might hold the force and place of the \[previous\] Rule as if \[written\] by His Holiness, that it might be done, ordered, established, and set, and that it might be inviolably kept and agreed to by all the friars and nuns of the said Order and by any other people of it \[the Order\], and not violated by any person. And thus, by us it is done, ordered, and established. His Holiness confirms and approves it and commands that it be read in  the chapters and convents and communities as that Rule, and just as the other Rules of all the other Orders are read, giving and granting authority to the said Visitor General Minister and those who were \[a Visitor General\] at some time, that they may be able to interpret and declare on whatever ambiguity that might occur for a time to the said Order \[in the\] rules, bulls, constitutions, statutes, and customs. And in all things aforementioned and written above, they and no other may interpret, declare, say, and pass judgement on them, and set their interpretation, declaration, decision, and judgment. In the said holy bull, given to us and to our Sacred Community and Order of Penitence, contains it, which bull commences: *Bishop **CLEMENT**, servant of the servants of God, for a permanent remembrance of this matter, for furtherance of the fruit of the womb, that is, the Sacred Order of Penitence, which the Seraphic, true fisher of men, for the benefit of all souls, appointed to be created, \[which\] he who did not hide himself from the heat of love in the Holy Spirit, the illumined Blessed Francis, founded, in awe of the Lord and said hitherto, etc.*—the which said bull, to avoid detailedness, we do not deem to include here (and because regarding it sufficient 

### fol. 5v
notice was given in the General Chapter to all the community members who attended it, prelates as well as subjects). And for himself, and in the name of the entire order, they obey it, together with the other bull: that in the execution of the said bull, he gives its sanctity. And also, he commands himself to give sufficient notice regarding the said bulls, to all the convents of the said order so that, more verifiably, he can be certain of the truth for them. And so, we have it here, *word for word*, in words and incorporation, and so on. And since those sayings to us, the Visitor General Minister and president and definers of the agreement and in accordance to all our general chapter which we celebrate here in this present *Sunday octave of the birth of the holy John the Baptist*. In this, our house and monastery, and the convent of St Mary of the Valley, of the *diocese of Asturias*. Seeing how well this is done and provided, and what in our other chapters we have done, established, and ordered. And customs that the Order has, we praise and approve all of it. And we establish and command, according to that in the relation of the said holy bull and in it and in the other bulls and apostolic faculties, statutes, ordinances, and customs it contains. And in this present time, and by the Apostolic Authority, it has been committed to us in this region by the said most holy Pope, our Clement VII, by the said holy bull he has granted us, and by the authority that he grants to us to carry out the renewed Rule, ordinances, constitutions, and statutes into perpetuity. May they be taken as the Rule and held in its entirety, force and vigour, conforming to us with the seasons and times, and providing

### fol. 6r
in the things that seem to us good and beneficial and useful, and \[as\] improves good governance and discipline and decorum and conservation of the said Order and Community of Penitence and the salvation of all the community members of it, using the said licence, power, and authority in that way and form and order that we are able to and ought to here in our General Chapter, first celebrated after the said granting of the said holy bull, assigned in this devout house of Our Lady St Mary of the Valley. We make, establish, and make known the Rule, ordinations, constitutions, ordinances, statutes, and following precepts.

¶. *The kingdom of heaven suffreth violence* (Matthew 11:12) *in accordance with penitence*. 

¶. Here begins the Rule of the Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance of our Seraphic father St Francis, likewise for the friars and nuns who live together in houses and monasteries as do the hermits, widowers, celibates, married people, and people of this age:

¶. The community of all the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal and any other region whatsoever.

¶ *Here it begins happily*.

¶ *Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand*. (Matthew 3:2 and 4:17)

¶ *\[From the Gospel of\] Matthew, Chapters 3 and 4*.

¶ Chapter 1: concerning the estates and people of this Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance.

### fol. 6v
First, we command and establish and declare that in this Sacred Order of Penitence there are four estates and different kinds of community members. As the Gospel says, “in my Father’s house there are many mansions” (John 14:2). And let it be in this way that the first and principal and most perfect estate is of the brothers and nuns who live in houses and convents together professing the three essential vows: it is fitting to know obedience, chastity, and poverty in particular. They pledge these vows from now onward and remember that which the Lord says in the holy Gospel, giving us doctrine as he would have us follow: he says, “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come follow me” (Matthew 19:21). And he says, moreover, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24). And those brothers of this first estate ought to be and will be priests, excepting those who the convents have and wish to have for the service of their houses and churches and people. The second estate \[is\] of hermits: those \[living\] in hermitages and deserts, following the hermitic life in imitation of the Desert Fathers from of the land of Egypt, who in the same way after they have taken up their vows carry out and pledge the said three essential vows. The third estate \[is\] of celibate and blessed widowers, and any other people who go dressed in this habit and occupation: those who pledge a vow of obedience to their prelates and a vow of

### fol. 7r
chastity and \[a vow to keep\] the divine commandments. The fourth estate \[is\] of married people, who likewise pledge a vow of obedience to their prelates and a vow of conjugal chastity and \[of\] the divine commandments in such a way so as to take up an occupation in this estate. Whoever of those that do it after \[a marriage\] would not be able to dissolve a marriage due to the death of someone, \[or\] to marry again, but remains forever in the third estate of celibate widowers. All those four estates His Holiness, as stated in his bull, recently granted to this Order (the which already reported above) for the true brothers and community members and nuns of the said holy Order of Penitence and for the true children of our father St Francis, so that by such, they are assisted and bound. They may delight *in an eternity* of merciful indulgences and pardons and freedoms, immunities, exceptions and privileges granted, and those being granted *in the future*, to the said Order and to the mendicant Orders and St Clare, and \[granted\] to us, the said Friar Antonio de Tablada, Visitor and General Minister, and the President and Limiters in this Chapter, for this, our Rule and declaration, with respect to the power granted to us, for such we hold and we delegate and we declare, now and from here onward forever and ever. This we declare to be the true intelligence of the said bull and of His Holiness who granted it.

¶ Chapter 2: what those of the first estate may take to keep as their own, and that the poor convents may beg for alms.

### fol. 7v
*In the same manner*, we command and establish that the brothers and nuns who live together do not have their own belongings in particular, except communally. But taking into consideration that most of the houses of the said sacred Order are poor and lack other necessities, we allow that the said Visitor General Minister, without committing someone else, can give permission in such a way to the male and female community members in particular, like the convents in the community, so that for life or temporarily, they can have their own \[belongings\] in private, all of those that for the same permission that was given to them in the same manner, that ceasing the same permission, all of which would be left over for them or would have to the convent where professed individuals go and to his community. And in the meantime, the Visitor General Minister handles his own conscience, who for the time that he is or will be so, that he uses this power comfortably, not having with respect to a particular passion, nor another thing except only help with or save the necessity that appears to him that there is, and they have those houses, community members, and people, without offering a hand to superfluous and voluntary matters. And because he makes clear to us (and we know in the said Sacred Order of Penitence), having many convents and poor houses this way of brothers, just like those of nuns and other male and female community members who are poor and live on \[begging for\] alms. We establish and declare that they can beg *from door to door* whatever alms in that manner, and as the other mendicant orders have begged. And for those faithful Christians who give them those alms, may they gain and obtain our thanks, pardons, and

### fol. 8r
indulgences, and for those who gain, obtain, and enjoy, those who give alms to the other mendicant Orders and St Clare. But we order that such male and female community members of the said convents or any other persons of the said four estates that when they go to beg \[for\] the said alms they would ask permission from their prelates or from the minister or of the abbess of those convents and *not from others* being with the same permission and blessing from the prelate, there is no shame to ask \[it from them\], but they go with much confidence. Because as the apostle St Paul says, the Lord “being rich became poor” in this world for our love (2 Corinthians 8:9). The religious women of the poor convents, who are in the habit of going out and begging, should maintain in their journeys all honesty and always send out the elderly and ancient people, of whom one cannot be suspicious: nothing bad can be said about such people nor set as a bad example. As said in the chapter of seclusion of the said Order, and with all that they brought and the said alms to be given, in the name of the said monasteries and order: in coming to their homes, faithfully, they come with all, to their ministers or abbesses or to whom oversees such \[giving of or asking for\] alms.

¶. Chapter 3: concerning the most reverend father, \[the\] Visitor General Minister, and of his power, charge, and office.
Let us resign ourselves to \[following\] the ancient customs used and maintained, and to the issued bulls and apostolic letters to the said Order, and because nothing that moves itself or persuades
