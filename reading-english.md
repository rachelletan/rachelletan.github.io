### fol. 1r
**_Jesus,
in God’s name. Amen._**
\[From\] Our Friar Antonio
de Tablada, current Visitor General and
Principal Minister, servant of all of our glorious father St Francis’s
Sacred Order of Penitence of regular 
observance in these kingdoms of Spain and
Portugal, and other parts and provinces, etc, and our President
and Limiters of this present General Chapter, which we celebrate
in the devout house and monastery of Our Lady St
Mary of the Valley of Asturias in the diocese determined by our said
Vistor General on this Sunday, the Octave of the Blessed
John the Baptist in this year, one thousand five hundred and 
twenty-eight (1528) years from the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
in which we are congregated with apostolic authority
by virtue of the holy bull _Ad uberes fructus_, once again
granted to us and to our Sacred Order of Penitence by our
most holy Pope Clement VII: 
To you, the very loved children, both brother friars and nuns, as those who
live together in houses and monasteries as hermits
and celibates, widows and married people, and religious men
and women of all our seraphic father St Francis’s Sacred Order of Penitence 
of the regular observance from all the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal 
and its provinces and other parts: 
As those who at present are under the yoke and
discipline of our obedience, just as those who were, from here onward
for ever and ever, health and peace to you within the Lord who is the true and
lasting health: 
You know well, and you ought to know, how much our
sacred community and Order of Penitence, with the divine hand governing it,
maintaining it, and enhancing it and adorning
it, has grown and has expanded, shone and flourished—not only

### fol. 1v
from notable barons and nuns, but from holy and clear
branches canonized by the Holy Apostolic See, whose
excellent lives and works shine like the
stars in the firmament of the sky, from whom lingers such a sweet
odor in divine observance, and who in this age have enjoyment of 
the fame of the most holy and blessed, giving everyone such
a notable example, and in the other perpetual and true
rest—which \[Order\], according to his ordinance, originated from and was started
and introduced by our blessed seraphic father St Francis, 
true shepherd and fisher of souls, illuminated and governed by the Holy Spirit,
and was put together, governed, approved, and commanded to obey
by our very holy Pope Nicholas IV of glorious
memory, and by other most supreme pontiffs,
confirmed and affirmed and grown from many indulgences
and pardons, naming it with the reason “of penitence.” And, it seems
and appears just as clear, they were examined by
the divine hand, through which they had such great fame, so as to
appear that it \[the Order\] was preordained, was founded, by our sovereign
God in an earthly Paradise, because—knowing in his divine wisdom
that our first father had sinned and so all of us with him—
he wanted to provide him \[Adam\] and us with the remedy and
medicine of penitence there where he established and ordered the penitence
with which \[people\] could weld our failures and defects and cause a
reconciliation between God and him, for where he \[Adam\] left and caused
death, He \[God\] would arise and resurrect life. 
Whereby: clearly the said sacred community and Order of Penitence appears
to be instituted, preordained, and founded there, and the 
growth has been such that, being established at the outset
for married people so that they might live in their houses and in
particular \[live\] beyond the divine precepts obligatory only to

### fol. 2r
obedience, now and many times since there have been and are
in it \[the Order\] men and women, friars and nuns, \[and\] academic
scholars who preach the divine word; and, permitting
the active life of married people, they live in many laudable
and honourable monasteries that they have made and acquired, where
they have elevated, raised, and illuminated their thoughts
and understandings and works in a contemplative life,
continually praising their saints and \[making\] divine
clamours and prayers \[in\] the name of their highest maker,
denying their own wills, subjecting them \[their wills\]
to the yoke of religion, pledging the three essential vows—
obedience, chastity, and poverty—valuing
divine things through genuine and steady means, abandoning
the world and its pleasures and vanities, enduring hunger,
cold, and thirst by sailing out to sea in that open ocean of contemplation
and continuing praise of our Sovereign Lord, exchanging
earthly possessions and leaving them for heavenly ones,
and \[leaving\] those temporary \[ones\] for perpetual ones. And since it \[the Order\] 
was established for one state \[of being\]—the divine providence
making use their immense benefits through it—it has been 
increased not only to married people but to friars
and nuns who live in convents, houses, and monasteries
together, and to hermitages and to celibate widowers
and to other people of this habit. 
So, certain of all this, by our very holy current Pope Clement VII,
searching through his spirit and considering
how much the said sacred community and Order
of Penitence might deserve to be honoured and praised,
through his open bull, graciously written in Latin and on
parchment, and at the end sealed with his stamp of lead hanging on those 
coloured silks, in accordance with the style and custom of

### fol. 2v
Rome, _as a permanent record of the matter_: “I confirm and
approve and once again grant \[that\] the said Sacred Order
and Religion of Penitence, based on indulgences and concessions
and preeminences, graces and liberties, exemptions,
pardons, privileges, prerogatives, and immunities, 
wanting and commanding that, just as through many other 
apostolic letters, it has had the exemption of the Orders that were 
established for our blessed father St Francis and has, between the first Order 
and the other Orders, been established, ordained, commanded, and judged 
in good judgment contradictory to the Roman Curia…” And it \[the bull\] 
has about three sentences in accordance with and executory to all
of the above. And the fourth sentence, by way of restitution, \[is\] given
for the auditors of the sacred Rota \[i.e., the registry book\] on confirmation
of the others with executory powers over all of them, which
do not have commixation nor annexation, and the book \[the Rota\] excepting entirely
the said Sacred Order and Convent of Penitence from the other Orders. 
And he \[Clement\] does not wish that they do not mix with each other
before it may be freely removed and principal Order itself be mendicant,
as the other Orders. And they may not have any prelate nor Ordinary nor
person of another Order, likewise of the minor observers,
as of family and cloister, be of another Order, nor
some other person, \[nor\] older or younger prelate, nor of
lower superiority, nor an entrance or exit in it. And 
the Visitor General Ministers are to be immediately subject,
for a time, as representatives to the holy Apostolic See,
taking them under his protection and refuge
and into all his Order. Likewise, “I confirm and once
again grant what they rejoice in: \[that\] the said Sacred Order of Spain,

### fol. 3r
the prelate, Visitor General Minister, and friars and nuns, hermits, and married people and religious people, and their houses and monasteries, and all their possessions and male and female servants and familiars, all the privileges, liberties, exemptions and prerogatives, immunities, indulgences, and pardons that the other four mendicant orders \(and St Clare\) have enjoyment of. They are granted, and should be granted from here onward, by the holy Apostolic See, or in another manner, not only by similarity to them but more equally and primarily and finally without any difference, freely and justly, and likewise as, them.” And moreover he \[Clement VII\] granted that all the estates of the above contents and \[those\] expressed below, that they are \[as\] friars and nuns who live together in convents upholding the three essential vows. It is fitting to know obedience, chastity, and poverty in particular. And hermits, widowers, chaste people and married people, and other people of the said Sacred Order of Penitence: may they become true siblings and communities from it. And he \[Clement VII\] defends, prohibits, refuses, and commands—under penalty of excommunication, beating, judgement and privation of dignities, professions, and benefits, and disqualification—to show others by way of the statute and declaration and of ordinance: that from here onward, no friar or person of the Order of St Francis of this observance, whether family member or cloistered or lay person or community, be called, as was customary, “Thirds,” like some of ours call them, but rather friars and nuns of the Sacred Order of Penitence of the Regular Observance of St Francis. They will be named this way in their writings and public acts. As in the other matter,

### fol. 3v
let them not be called nor named by another less honourable term, or enter into their monasteries, houses—and any properties—or visit the masters or ministers of the said Orders of Observance, either family or cloister, or by his commissaries, vicars, and ordinaries, nor by any other person, whether wishing to disturb or perturb, or inconvenience or alter \[the Order\] in whatever manner, or for whatever way that it may be or can be, or to \[visit\] his Visitor General Minister \[concerning\] the obedience, visitation, correction, superiority, and profession, or in any other manner public or secretly, \[or\] by virtue of whatever bull and apostolic graces *granted and in the future to be granted*—all of which, with the filing of a suit concerning an irritating decree, he has repealed and pleaded, that they be absolved of such punishment by no one except the Roman pontiff. Moreover, he gives power such that all the said four estates—the communities and individuals of this Sacred Order—can eat meat on all the Mondays of the year, in the same way that the eating of meat is not prohibited by the Roman Church from the Feast of St Martin until the Sunday when the Advent of the Lord is celebrated by the Church \[i.e., from Nov. 11 to early Dec.\]. Furthermore, His Holiness grants and has awarded and commands that only the Visitor General (and anyone who for a time he might delegate from his Order), and not any other, may receive or give the habit \[of the Order\] to anyone in this age who might come to this Sacred Order and Community of Penitence. They may not be received into its profession by another. And \[Clement commands\] that the friar, nun, community women or men in any path that \[they\] may be: if
