subtitle: Why create a minimal digital edition?
---

I present my digital edition of MS.Span.1 via a GitHub Pages website using the theme “Beautiful Jekyll” created by Dean Attali. Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator: it transforms inputted text into a static website according to a defined layout or theme. My decision to use a Jekyll theme in the creation of the digital edition rests heavily on Jekyll’s third core philosophy, which describes Jekyll as “focus\[ing\] on content first and foremost, making the process of publishing content on the Web easy. Users should find the management of their content enjoyable and simple.”

“Simplicity” is a key word here. While I could have opted for more elaborate—and potentially more complicated—ways to generate the website for a digital edition of MS.Span.1, it was not necessary to do so, nor in line with my own core philosophies of creating minimal and accessible approaches for users and readers; I chose a simple and robust (in the sense of sturdy and sustainable) solution.

This choice also aligns with my aims of foregrounding the textual components of MS.Span.1 (as opposed to the rest of the manuscript’s physical features or the features of the website itself) and of improving the accessibility of the text via the internet: fewer features on the website means users are less likely to be distracted by the usability of the site and more likely to focus on the content.

Further, a stable website with relatively few external dependencies means that the site is less likely to break down, and hence become unavailable, in the future. Purposely choosing to engage in computing practices that are not high-performance serves to address these main questions raised by minimal computing: what do we need, and what don’t we need? We need an infrastructure that is easy to use and lasts, and not necessarily one that is aesthetically pleasing but complicated.
