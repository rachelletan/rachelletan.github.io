subtitle: A brief description of MS.Span.1 and the Franciscan Rule
---

The Franciscan Third Order, whose members were commonly called “Thirds” or “Tertiaries,” consisted of lay people who wished to live with their families and in non-monastic communities while adhering to the penitential and regular religious life of Franciscan orders. Belonging to such a community provided members with opportunities for fellowship and solidarity within a religious and devotional framework, relatively new opportunities for lay people in the late middle ages (Moorman 560).

The semi-monastic Rule that these Tertiaries followed was first instituted by Pope Nicholas IV in the 1289 bull _Supra montem_. This provided general guidelines for how Tertiaries were to live their lives, but it did not attempt to separate them from the rest of the world. However, throughout the years, some Tertiaries gradually withdrew from the world and came to prefer the seclusion of convents and monasteries; these individuals then sought papal authorization of a Rule that would recognize them as distinct from their more “secular” lay peers. Finally, the fifteenth century “saw the permanent division of the Tertiaries between those called ‘secular’ who continued to live in their own houses, and those who adopted the monastic life under a formal Rule and so came to be known as the Third Order Regular” (Moorman 560). 

The Rule that comprises MS.Span.1 is of this type, derived from that authorized by Pope Leo X in the 1521 bull _Inter cetera_, which confirmed but augmented the guidelines set forth Nicholas IV’s 1289 bull. The renewed Rule documented in MS.Span.1 is significant in that it provides a further revision of Leo’s 1521 bull—via an additional augmentation provided in Clement VII’s 1526 _Ab uberes fructus_—and demonstrates the efforts of the Third Order Regulars to continue to differentiate themselves from their secular peers.

The contents of MS.Span.1 are divided into thirty-four sections, which can be described in three main groupings. The first grouping (fols. 1r1-6r24) contains the preface and introduction to the renewed Third Order Regular Rule, revised in accordance with Clement VII’s bull. The second grouping (fols. 6r25-32r21) contains the thirty chapters of the Rule, which outline the ordinances, constitutions, and statutes that members of the Regular Order must follow. The third short grouping (fols. 32r22-33r17) contains an “exhortation” and the one-line scribal colophon “Un aue maria por quien la escriuio” (fol. 33r17).

The manuscript begins with a prologue describing on whose behalf the text was produced: “Nos fray antonio de tablada moderno vissitador general y mjnjstro principal, sieruo de toda la sagrada orden de penjtençia de nuestro glorioso padre sant françisco de la Regular obseruançia” (fol. 1r3-7), and for whom it was intended: “A uos los muy amados hiJos y hermanos frayles y monJas … Como hermjtannos y continentes, biudos y conJugados y Religiosos y Religiosas de toda nuestra sagrada orden de penjtençia” (fol. 1r).

The manuscript was written by a single scribe (fol. 33r17), and presumably over a short period of time so that multiple copies of this text could have been made in order to disseminate this revised Rule to the chapters and convents of the Third Order Regular and its members in Spain and Portugal. As the Visitor General Minister, Friar Antonio de Tablada would have issued the Rule at the Order’s General Chapter meeting of 1528 (fol. 1r13-14.).

The presentation of this Rule in that meeting, which is the first that the Order celebrated after the granting of Clement VII’s _Ad uberes fructus_ (fol. 1r16), is significant because the text acknowledges and responds to the provisions laid out by that papal bull by dedicating several chapters detailing the appointment and powers of the new Visitor General Minister and his administration of the Third Order Regular. Moreover, the text also describes Tablada’s involvement in bringing the renewed Rule into effect: “y mando qujso y estableçio y ordeno que tuvisse fuerza y vez de Regla como si por su sanctidad, fuese hecha y ordenada y esta bleçida y a ella se estuviesse. y fuese jnviolablemente guardada y obtemperada por todos los frayles y monJas de la dicha orden” (fols. 4v28-5r5).

Thus, the text of MS.Span.1, as the prologue suggests, was a reference work for all matters pertaining to the administration of the Order. The revised Rule emphasized the specific powers, jurisdiction, and duties of the Visitor General Minister, as the highest position of authority within the Order, as well as his expected conduct during monastic visitations and the Order’s chapter meetings.
