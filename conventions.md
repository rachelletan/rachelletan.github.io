## A note on transcription
Transcription conventions follow, where appropriate, those outlined by David MacKenzie in A Manual of Manuscript Transcription for the Dictionary of Old Spanish Language, as revised and expanded in the 5th ed. by Ray Harris Norhill (Madison, 1997), as well as by Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham in Introduction to Manuscript Studies (Ithaca, 2007), pp. 75-77. The transcription is a semi-diplomatic one. In an effort to reproduce this text as closely to its manuscript state as possible, I retain the scribeâ€™s capitalization, punctuation (or lack thereof), line breaks, paraph marks, indentations, and rubrication, and I have made no attempt to revise or modernize the existing text or its orthography. When spelling variation or scribal errors appear in the manuscript, I have not corrected nor standardized them. However, I have expanded all abbreviations present in the manuscript text and indicated expansions with parentheses.
