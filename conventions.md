## A note on transcription
Transcription conventions follow, where appropriate, those outlined by David MacKenzie in _A Manual of Manuscript Transcription for the Dictionary of Old Spanish Language_, as revised and expanded in the 5th ed. by Ray Harris Norhill (Madison, 1997), as well as by Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham in _Introduction to Manuscript Studies_ (Ithaca, 2007), pp. 75-77.

The transcription is a semi-diplomatic one; that is, it attempts to reflect the manuscript text and appearance as accurately as possible while also using minor adjustments for ease of reading. For example, I have expanded scribal abbreviations and normalized the space between words. In an effort to reproduce this text as closely to its manuscript state as possible, however, I retain the scribe’s capitalization, punctuation (or lack thereof), line breaks, paraph marks, indentations, and rubrication, and I have made no attempt to revise or modernize the existing text or its orthography. Where spelling variation or scribal errors appear in the manuscript, I have not corrected nor standardized them. All expanded abbreviations present are indicated with parentheses.

With the exception of the cursive title written on the binding, this manuscript is written in an Iberian Gothic Rotunda bookhand, with rubricated text divisions and the occasional decorated initial at the beginning of chapters or major manuscript groupings. These decorative elements structure the book and serve to draw readers’ attention to section and chapter divisions, presumably for ease of use and as finding aids.

The legibility and regularity of the scribe’s handwriting in MS.Span.1 and its clear formal structure allowed relatively easy access the text; the process would have been more laborious, for instance, with a text comprised of variable letter forms like those of typical semi-cursive Elizabethan Secretary hands. This, in turn, guided how I chose to structure the remediated work: in my transcription, I have elected to maintain the folio divisions by enclosing the folio numbers—and indicating if the side is recto or verso—in square brackets, to allow the modern reader to easily cross-reference the transcription to the very legible manuscript itself.

## A note on translation
While most of MS.Span.1 is in the Spanish vernacular, the scribe also copied and employed Latin with some frequency. Code switching from Spanish to Latin without indication or script change is not uncommon in the text. Many of the Latin words are stock phrases that emerged from religious or legal contexts—for example, _item_ (“in like manner” or “also”) and _ad perpetuam_ (“everlasting” or “permanently”) are repeated frequently, subtly emphasizing the official nature of this Rule—though Latin quotation of papal bulls, Bible verses, and prayers are also included.

In the translation, I italicize the words translated from Latin for ease of identification, with the exception of words that retain their Latinate spelling and use in English today. For example, the Lord’s Prayer (i.e., the “Our Father”) appears in the manuscript as Latin _Pater Noster_; however, I retain the common noun “paternoster” in the English, so that the translated text stays close to the original text wherever possible.
