## A note on transcription
Transcription conventions follow, where appropriate, those outlined by David MacKenzie in _A Manual of Manuscript Transcription for the Dictionary of Old Spanish Language_, as revised and expanded in the 5th ed. by Ray Harris Norhill (Madison, 1997), as well as by Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham in _Introduction to Manuscript Studies_ (Ithaca, 2007), pp. 75-77.

The transcription is a semi-diplomatic one. In an effort to reproduce this text as closely to its manuscript state as possible, I retain the scribe’s capitalization, punctuation (or lack thereof), line breaks, paraph marks, indentations, and rubrication, and I have made no attempt to revise or modernize the existing text or its orthography. When spelling variation or scribal errors appear in the manuscript, I have not corrected nor standardized them. However, I have expanded all abbreviations present in the manuscript text and indicated expansions with parentheses.

## A note on translation
While most of MS.Span.1 is in the Spanish vernacular, the scribe also copied and employed Latin with some frequency. Code switching from Spanish to Latin without indication or script change is not uncommon in the text. Many of the Latin words are stock phrases that emerged from religious or legal contexts—for example, _item_ (“in like manner” or “also”) and _ad perpetuam_ (“everlasting” or “permanently”) are repeated frequently, subtly emphasizing the official nature of this Rule—though Latin quotation of papal bulls, Bible verses, and prayers are also included.

In the translation, I italicize the words translated from Latin for ease of identification, with the exception of words that retain their Latinate spelling and use in English today. For example, the Lord’s Prayer (i.e., the “Our Father”) appears in the manuscript as Latin _Pater Noster_; however, I retain the common noun “paternoster” in the English, so that the translated text stays close to the original text wherever possible.
