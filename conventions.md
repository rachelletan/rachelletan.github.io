## A note on transcription
Transcription conventions follow, where appropriate, those outlined by David MacKenzie in _A Manual of Manuscript Transcription for the Dictionary of Old Spanish Language_, as revised and expanded in the 5th ed. by Ray Harris Norhill (Madison, 1997), as well as by Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham in _Introduction to Manuscript Studies_ (Ithaca, 2007), pp. 75-77.

The transcription is a semi-diplomatic one. In an effort to reproduce this text as closely to its manuscript state as possible, I retain the scribeâ€™s capitalization, punctuation (or lack thereof), line breaks, paraph marks, indentations, and rubrication, and I have made no attempt to revise or modernize the existing text or its orthography. When spelling variation or scribal errors appear in the manuscript, I have not corrected nor standardized them. However, I have expanded all abbreviations present in the manuscript text and indicated expansions with parentheses.
