subtitle: Remediating an Early Modern Spanish manuscript
---

Medieval and early modern manuscripts, often not on display to the public, offer rich historical, cultural, and technical fields of study. While there are important reasons, related to preservation, why such manuscripts are kept in special areas of a library or secured and hidden in private collections, other factors that hinder the accessibility of a text include the ability to read (or decipher) medieval or early modern handwriting and the ability to understand the language in which the text was written.

In general, the physical or electronic accessibility of a text currently poses less of an issue than its textual or linguistic accessibility. One may go to a collection or library to examine the physical object, and, increasingly, digital surrogates (e.g., digital facsimiles or editions) offer viable substitutes for the object itself. However, these surrogates do not provide sufficient access to a reader who is unable to understand a manuscript’s text. At the University of Victoria, a recently acquired codex that allows us to consider these factors for the modern reader, whether in the scholarly world or the general public, is Victoria, McPherson Library, MS.Span.1.

Acquired by University of Victoria Special Collections and Archives in 2015 through its regular Special Collection Acquisition Fund, MS.Span.1 is a sixteenth-century manuscript (ca. 1528-1530) containing a revised Rule of the Franciscan Third Order Regular and written in Early Modern Spanish. MS.Span.1 dates between 24 June 1528 and ca. 1530—that is, it cannot be earlier than the date of the General Chapter meeting of the Order mentioned in its prologue, but it may be a slightly later copy—and it is now housed in University of Victoria Special Collections and Archives with the call number BX3654 A3 1528. The title _Regla de la Orden Sagrada de Penitencia de la Nuestra Seraphica Padre Sant Francisco_ appears on the contemporary limp parchment binding of the manuscript in a cursive hand that appears to be slightly later than the manuscript itself. The binding, however, is likely original.

The text of MS.Span.1 is written in a very fine Iberian Gothic Rotunda bookhand,  mainly in Early Modern Spanish but with occasional Latin. No copies of the same text that comprises MS.Span.1 are now known to exist, nor has the text of MS.Span.1 ever before been printed or edited (see Les Enluminures, "Vendor Description").  Thus, there is a need to make this resource more accessible to the public. Projects similar to this one have endeavoured to do so by leveraging the advantages of information sharing now afforded by digital environments. For example, Danielle Grant observes in her Master’s thesis, which considers how the remediation of London, British Library MS Harley 4205 as a digital facsimile increases accessibility to the book, that “[t]he digital environment allows information to be stored, linked, and engaged with in a style that print technologies cannot achieve so effectively.”  Owing to the current lack of scholarship on the Franciscan Third Order and its Regular Rule, as well as the lack of public awareness of the existence of this renewed Rule (a revision of one issued earlier in the sixteenth century),  this project establishes a foundational resource for MS.Span.1, which can be used by the University of Victoria for reference and made available for future students, educators, and researchers.

Central to making the text of MS.Span.1 more accessible is the creation of an open access minimal digital edition of the manuscript that comprises a digital facsimile, a semi-diplomatic transcription (that is, a faithful rendering of the manuscript’s text with all scribal abbreviations expanded), and a translation into Modern English, as well as an online GitHub Pages website that hosts a more concise version of this introduction and a bibliography.

Like Grant’s thesis, this project is a work of remediation, which Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin define as “the way in which one medium is seen by our culture as reforming or improving upon another” (59) and “the formal logic by which new media refashion prior media forms” (273). With Bolter and Grusin’s definition in mind, this digital edition and translation of MS.Span.1 aims to improve the accessibility of the text in two main ways, namely (1) by reproducing the text such that its visual and textual information is retained in a digital version, and (2) by assisting the modern reader in their interactions with the late-medieval text.  All of the components of this project work together to accomplish a more enhanced reading experience, even for non-specialist readers.
