<b>Regla</b> is a digital edition of <i>Regla de la Sagrada Orden de Penitencia de la Nuestra Seraphica Padre Sant Francisco</i> 
(c. 1528-1530) (Victoria, McPherson Library, MS.Span.1) created by MA student Rachelle Ann Tan from the Department of English at 
the University of Victoria.
<br>
The main menu contains information about the project and relevant resources. The main section is the Edition, where you can find
the transcription of the manuscript in its original Spanish, a reading edition in English, and scanned images of MS.Span.1.
<br>
I have created this site with the purpose of making the text of MS.Span.1 more accessible to the public based on the principles of 
remediation and minimal computing.
