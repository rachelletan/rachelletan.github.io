<b>Regla</b> is a digital edition of <i>Regla de la Sagrada Orden de Penitencia de la Nuestra Seraphica Padre Sant Francisco</i> 
(c. 1528-1530) (Victoria, McPherson Library, MS.Span.1) created by MA student Rachelle Ann Tan from the Department of English at 
the University of Victoria.

The menu above contains information about the project and relevant resources. The main section is the MS.SPAN.1, where you can find
the transcription of the manuscript in its original Spanish and Latin, its translation into English, and high-resolution scanned images of the manuscript.
<br>
<br>
I have created this site with the purpose of making the text of MS.Span.1 more accessible to the public based on the principles of 
remediation and minimal computing.
