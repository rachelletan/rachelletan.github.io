I am a master's student in the department of English at the University of Victoria and a part-time technical writer for the BC government. Whether it is through my research, writing, or teaching, I am passionate about making technologies work and be more accessible for people.

This digital edition of **Regla** is my capstone project which partially fulfills the requirements of the MA in English.
