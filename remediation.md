This project is a work of remediation, and it thus pays particular attention to the effectiveness of the use of a different medium to achieve the goal of improving the accessibility of MS.Span.1’s text for those primarily working in the English language. The following are some questions that emerged as I developed the digital edition of the manuscript:
- By changing the medium of the text, was the project able to achieve what I had intended it to do?
- What does making a text to be read and understood tell me about its politics and aesthetics?
- Did I gain or lose something in the process? If so, what are these gains and/or losses?

These lines of inquiry inform my critical aim of testing the relevance of the various choices I made and the conventions I followed throughout this project.

While the digital environment cannot fully reproduce or represent the materiality of a medieval manuscript, it nevertheless presents various affordances for manipulating the latter’s visual and textual elements. For example, the digitized images of the manuscript can be virtually cut, copied, and pasted for the purpose of reproducing them, and their high-resolution allows them to be magnified or color-corrected for the purpose of making their minute features more visible.

Additionally, applying more advanced forensic techniques in the analysis of this manuscript might also aid in the identification of its provenance and ownership history, which is otherwise difficult to know while relying only on its physical capabilities. Although the manuscript in some ways loses its materiality (e.g., the relative importance of its physical survival, the feel of its parchment) as it becomes digitized, it also gains the quality of dynamism as it enters a new digital materiality. The digitized manuscript becomes more flexible and can be manipulated to suit the modern reader’s various needs: despite the original manuscript’s static fragility and rarity, its digital reproduction is stripped of these limitations and becomes a robust commodity. Thus, one no longer needs to worry about the damaging the original; the remediated text is available for use and consumption indefinitely.

Creating a new way to access a text inevitably tests the relevance of the remediated text’s design, as a measure of its effectiveness in delivering the desired outcome of improving readability. As I mentioned above, for instance, the transcription conventions I have followed aim to assist the modern reader through the ability to cross-reference the text of the transcription to that of the original manuscript. There are several features gained as a result of this transcription and digital presentation: abbreviations and contractions are expanded, folio numbers are added to indicate where the text begins in its now-comparable original, letter forms become more legible, spacing is standardized, and the text takes up comparatively less space on the page than in its original form.

Although efforts were made to follow the layout of the original manuscript, however, several features were also lost in the processing of the text: any scribal marks pertaining to an abbreviation or contraction, decorations around the page of the manuscript or on initial letters and capitals, and even the grace of the scribe’s skilled bookhand—all of which indicate that the text was produced laboriously and meticulously by human intention and intervention—are absent or at least less apparent.

As in the creation of the digital facsimile, the material (the parchment, the binding, the smell of it) is lost in the transcription. But we are left with familiar letter forms which allow us to focus more on the text itself. The remediated medieval manuscript, in a digital state, thus becomes an invitation to read, use, and understand the past, the text, and even the object itself by those who might otherwise never encounter it.
